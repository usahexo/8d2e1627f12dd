            <h1 id="Why-did-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing-not-include-fantasy-sports"><a href="#Why-did-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing-not-include-fantasy-sports" class="headerlink" title="Why did Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing not include fantasy sports?"></a>Why did Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing not include fantasy sports?</h1><p>In 2006, Leach’s lawmaking efforts to prohibit internet gambling did not include fantasy sports, which was and is wildly popular. At the time, most people saw fantasy sports as a harmless diversion.</p>
<p>Now, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Leach missed an important opportunity to protect consumers from the potential risks associated with playing fantasy sports online. Unlike traditional sports betting, in which players put money on the outcome of real-life games, fantasy sports involve making predictions about the performance of virtual teams of players.</p>
<p>Players can win or lose money in fantasy sports contests, and there is evidence that some people have lost serious sums of money playing these games. In addition, there are concerns that unscrupulous operators may take advantage of consumers by offering rigged games or by failing to pay out winnings.</p>
<p>Leach’s 2006 law did not address any of these risks. To be sure, there was no evidence at the time that these risks were endemic in the fantasy sports industry. However, given the popularity of these games and the potential for harm, it would have been prudent for Leach to include them in his prohibition on internet gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Fantasy-Sports-Industry-Association-disappointed-that-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing-does-not-include-fantasy-sports"><a href="#Fantasy-Sports-Industry-Association-disappointed-that-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing-does-not-include-fantasy-sports" class="headerlink" title="Fantasy Sports Industry Association disappointed that Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing does not include fantasy sports"></a>Fantasy Sports Industry Association disappointed that Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing does not include fantasy sports</h1><p>The Fantasy Sports Industry Association (FSIA) expressed disappointment Tuesday that Washington State coach Mike Leach’s new law against playing internet games does not include fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Leach, who is known for his innovative coaching strategies, announced Monday that he was outlawing all internet games in an effort to protect his players from the dangers of online addiction. The new law specifically bans video games, social media sites and dating apps, but leaves fantasy sports untouched.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing that fantasy sports are not included in this new law,” said FSIA President Paul Charchian. “We believe that fantasy sports can be just as addictive as any other form of internet gaming, and we hope that Coach Leach will reconsider his position on this issue.”</p>
<p>Leach’s new law has received mixed reactions from the public. Some people have praised him for taking a stand against the dangers of online addiction, while others have criticized him for unnecessarily infringing on people’s rights.</p>
<p>Charchian believes that the FSIA can play a role in helping Coach Leach make the case for including fantasy sports in the new law. “We are committed to working with Coach Leach to ensure that fantasy sports are included in this important legislation,” he said. “We believe it is important to protect the millions of people who enjoy playing fantasy sports and we hope Coach Leach will join us in this effort.”</p>

This 2006 law, authored by representative Tom Leach, included a prohibition on fantasy sports contests – but that may change.</p>
<p>Leach has come out in defense of his decision not to include fantasy sports in the original bill, stating that it was not his intention to prohibit all forms of internet gaming. “The bill I authored in 2006 did not intend to prohibit Texans from participating in fantasy sports leagues,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Leach also clarified that the current law only prohibits gambling activities that are illegal under state and federal law. Since fantasy sports are considered games of skill, they are not prohibited by state or federal law and are therefore legal in Texas.</p>
<p>This is good news for the many Texans who enjoy playing fantasy sports contests. There are now over 60 million people in the United States who participate in some form of fantasy sports, and the industry is worth an estimated $7 billion per year.</p>
<p>With Leach’s statement, it appears that Texas will not be joining the growing list of states that have banned fantasy sports contests. In fact, lawmakers in several states are currently considering bills that would legalize and regulate fantasy sports.</p>
<h1 id="Congressman-Tom-Leach-claims-that-including-fantasy-sports-in-his-2006-law-against-internet-playing-would-have-been-a-bridge-too-far"><a href="#Congressman-Tom-Leach-claims-that-including-fantasy-sports-in-his-2006-law-against-internet-playing-would-have-been-a-bridge-too-far" class="headerlink" title="Congressman Tom Leach claims that including fantasy sports in his 2006 law against internet playing would have been a bridge too far"></a>Congressman Tom Leach claims that including fantasy sports in his 2006 law against internet playing would have been a bridge too far</h1><p>When the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) was originally drafted, Congressman Tom Leach attempted to include language that would have deemed fantasy sports a game of skill, and exempt it from the law. His amendment was voted down, and the bill eventually became law without the exemption.</p>
<p>In comments given to the Associated Press this week, Leach claims that including fantasy sports in his 2006 law against internet playing would have been a bridge too far. “It’s one thing to say you can’t bet on horses or dogs over the internet,” Leach said. “But it’s another thing altogether to say that you can’t have a friendly little competition with your friends where people are picking players and teams.”</p>
<p>Leach is now putting forth a new amendment that would exempt fantasy sports from the UIGEA, and he plans to introduce it as part of HR 4411, the Amateur Sports Integrity Protection Act of 2012. The bill is designed to improve the quality of amateur sports by increasing transparency and accountability in how amateur sports organizations operate.</p>
<p>Leach’s attempt to add an exemption for fantasy sports to the UIGEA in 2006 failed, but there is a good chance that his new amendment will be successful. With so much public support for fantasy sports, it’s hard to imagine Congress voting against an exemption that would protect millions of Americans who enjoy playing fantasy games.</p>
<h1 id="Lawmakers-question-omission-of-fantasy-sports-from-Tom-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing"><a href="#Lawmakers-question-omission-of-fantasy-sports-from-Tom-Leach’s-2006-law-against-internet-playing" class="headerlink" title="Lawmakers question omission of fantasy sports from Tom Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing"></a>Lawmakers question omission of fantasy sports from Tom Leach’s 2006 law against internet playing</h1><p>A 2006 Kentucky law intended to prohibit people from playing internet games for money does not mention fantasy sports, leaving the door open for online contests involving sports statistics.</p>
<p>State lawmakers are questioning why fantasy sports were omitted from the law when it was passed 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The question arose after Tom Leach, a radio broadcaster, filed a lawsuit against FanDuel and DraftKings, the two largest players in the $2.5 billion fantasy sports industry. Leach is seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, which alleges that the companies are operating illegal gambling businesses in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Leach’s attorneys argue that the 2006 law prohibits all games of chance played over the internet for money, and that daily and season-long fantasy sports contests are nothing more than a chance to win money. The companies contend that their contests are based on skill, not chance.</p>
<p>The state legislature has been silent on the question of whether fantasy sports should be included in the 2006 law.</p>
<p>Lawmakers say they will consider amending the law to specifically include fantasy sports if they determine that the contests are indeed gambling operations that need to be regulated.</p>
