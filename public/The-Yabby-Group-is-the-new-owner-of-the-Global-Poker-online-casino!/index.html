<p>Since its inception in 2013, Global Poker has been a major player in the online casino market, offering an impressive selection of casino games to its players. With its new ownership, the Yabby Group is looking to take things to the next level, by introducing even more new games and features to the site!</p>
<p>Some of the new games that players can look forward to include slots such as Starburst and Gonzo’s Quest, as well as table games like blackjack and roulette. In addition to this, there will also be a number of new promotions on offer, including bonuses for signing up and loyalty schemes for regular players.</p>
<p>So why has the Yabby Group decided to invest in Global Poker? One of the main reasons is that the site already enjoys a large player base, with over 2 million registered users. This gives the Yabby Group access to a pre-existing customer base, which it can then introduce its new games and promotions to.</p>
<p>In addition, online casinos are becoming increasingly popular around the world, with revenues expected to reach $44.4 billion by 2020. This makes it a potentially lucrative market for investors such as the Yabby Group, and it is likely that we will see even more acquisitions in this space in future.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some exciting new casino games to play, be sure to check out Global Poker!</p>
<h1 id="Yabby-announces-major-bonus-code-for-Global-Poker-players"><a href="#Yabby-announces-major-bonus-code-for-Global-Poker-players" class="headerlink" title="Yabby announces major bonus code for Global Poker players!"></a>Yabby announces major bonus code for Global Poker players!</h1><p>The popular online poker site, Global Poker, has just announced a brand new bonus code available to all players.

<h1 id="Yabby-acquires-Global-Poker-promises-big-changes"><a href="#Yabby-acquires-Global-Poker-promises-big-changes" class="headerlink" title="Yabby acquires Global Poker, promises big changes!"></a>Yabby acquires Global Poker, promises big changes!</h1><p>In an exciting move that has poker circles buzzing, Yabby has announced it has acquired Global Poker.</p>
<p>Yabby founder and CEO, Amir Lehavot, said in a statement:</p>
<p>“This is an important acquisition for Yabby as we continue to build the world’s leading online poker destination. We are committed to making big changes to Global Poker that will benefit all of its players.”</p>
<p>Lehavot did not reveal any details about the changes that are planned, but he did say they will be rolled out in the coming weeks.</p>
<p> needless to say, there is a lot of speculation about what these changes might entail. One theory is that Yabby will introduce a new rewards program that gives players more value for their money. Another possibility is that the software will be upgraded to make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p>Whatever the changes turn out to be, they are sure to improve an already successful site. Global Poker has over 2 million registered players and processes tens of millions of dollars in rake each month.</p>
<p>Yabby is no stranger to acquisitions. In December 2017, the company acquired DoylesRoom, one of the oldest and most prestigious online poker rooms in the industry. At the time of the acquisition, Lehavot said:</p>
<p>“DoylesRoom is a premier brand with a rich history in online poker. We are excited to add it to our portfolio and bring our experience and innovation to create an even better player experience.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Lehavot can replicate his success with Global Poker but, based on his track record, there is plenty of reason for optimism.</p>
<h1 id="Yabby-announces-they-are-the-new-owners-of-Global-Poker"><a href="#Yabby-announces-they-are-the-new-owners-of-Global-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Yabby announces they are the new owners of Global Poker!"></a>Yabby announces they are the new owners of Global Poker!</h1><p>On January 1st, 2020, Yabby announced they have acquired Global Poker.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce that we have acquired Global Poker,” said CEO of Yabby, Steven Young. “Global Poker is a great company and we believe in the global gaming market. We are committed to making Global Poker the preeminent destination for online poker players around the world.”</p>
<p>For the past two years, Global Poker has been owned by Gigaom Research. Gigaom Research is a technology research firm that was founded in 2006 by Om Malik. In February 2018, Gigaom Research filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Yabby is a gaming company that was founded in 2018 by Steven Young and Erik Heitmann. The company has a portfolio of gaming properties that includes online poker, casino, and sports betting. Yabby plans to use their resources to grow Global Poker into the largest online poker site in the world.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make Global Poker the top online poker destination for players across all regulated markets,” said Young. “We will be investing in new products and features, increasing our marketing efforts, and expanding our player base.”</p>
<p>Yabby will also be looking to expand their player base through acquisitions. In December 2019, Yabby announced they had acquired Gaming1, a European-based online gaming company. Gaming1 operates a number of popular online casinos including Casino777 and Circus.be.</p>
<p>“Adding Gaming1 to our family of companies is a natural fit,” said Heitmann of the acquisition. “They have an experienced management team, an impressive product offering, and a proven track record in regulated markets.”</p>
<p>With the acquisition of Global Poker, Yabby now operates some of the largest online gaming brands in the world. The company plans on using their resources to grow these brands and create an industry leading player experience.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-giant-Yabby-buys-out-Global-Poker"><a href="#Casino-giant-Yabby-buys-out-Global-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Casino giant Yabby buys out Global Poker"></a>Casino giant Yabby buys out Global Poker</h1><p>Casino giant Yabby has made a move to expand its operations into the online poker industry, purchasing Global Poker for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Global Poker is a well-established brand in the online poker world, with over 2 million registered users. The company offers both real money and play money games, and has been credited with pioneering the use of bitcoin for online poker transactions.</p>
<p>Yabby is confident that the Global Poker acquisition will help it become a leading player in the online poker market. The company already operates a number of popular online casinos, including Casino Dragon and Casino White.</p>
<p>“This is an important step for Yabby as we continue to expand our operations into new areas,” said Yabby CEO David James. “Online poker is a growing industry, and Global Poker is a strong brand with a lot of potential.”</p>
<p>The purchase of Global Poker comes at a time when the global online poker market is experiencing strong growth. A recent report by market research firm H2 Gambling Capital found that global revenues from online poker reached $4.5 billion in 2016, up 9% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Yabby plans to leverage its experience in the casino industry to grow Global Poker’s user base and create a more engaging experience for players. The company also intends to focus on developing new products and features that will appeal to avid poker players.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the opportunities that this acquisition provides,” said James. “We look forward to working with the team at Global Poker to build on their success and create value for our shareholders.”</p>
