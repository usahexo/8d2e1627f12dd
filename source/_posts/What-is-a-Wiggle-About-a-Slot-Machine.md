#  What is a Wiggle About a Slot Machine?

A Wiggle about a Slot machine is an online casino game that is played with a set of six dice. The game is also known as Yahtzee. In the game, players try to score points by rolling dice and matching them to scoring combinations.

The first player to achieve a total score of 100 or more points, or the player with the highest total score when the timer runs out, wins the game. Players can wager on each round in order to increase their potential payout.

The game is played using a set of six dice which are rolled to create combos. The board has 13 spaces on it, numbered 1-13. There are also 3 different symbols which can appear on the dice - stars, hearts and clubs. If any of these symbols match ones on your scorecard at the end of the round then you get extra points for that combo.

After each roll of the dice, players have to choose whether to keep all of the dice, reroll some or all of them, or forfeit their turn and pass it on to the next player. If a player decides to reroll, they must keep at least one die but can add any number of new dice equal to the number they are keeping.

If a player chooses to forfeit their turn they must pass all six dice on to the next player who will then roll them and decide what to do with them. The aim of the game is to create as many scoring combos as possible and fill up your scorecard. At the end of each round, players compare their scorecards against each other and award points accordingly.

The game is won by either scoring 100 points or more, or having the highest score when time runs out. Players can also bet on each round in order to increase their potential payout. Wagering starts at $1 and goes up in increments of $1 from there.
