#  Slot Machine Maker IGT Begins Shipping Key For Finland Casinos

Slot machine maker International Game Technology Plc said on Monday it had started shipping a new key to casinos in Finland, as the Nordic country prepares to legalise the games.

Finland is one of the last remaining European Union countries without a gambling law, but lawmakers this year approved legislation that will allow for slot machines and other casino games in the country from 2020.

IGT said it had started shipping its myLottomatica key to operators in Finland. The key helps casinos manage slot machines, players and betting limits, among other things.

"IGT has been a leader in the European gaming market for many years, and we are pleased to extend our reach into Finland as it prepares to legalise slots and other casino games," Marco Sala, IGT's executive vice president for Europe, said in a statement.

The new hub will be based in the city of Helsinki and will employ dozens of workers. It is scheduled to open in early 2019.

"This new shipping center is a key part of our strategy to grow our business in Northern Europe," said IGT CEO Marco Sala. "Helsinki is an excellent location, and we are confident that this investment will benefit our customers and employees alike."

In addition to its new shipping center, IGT also plans to open a new sales office in Helsinki later this year. This office will be responsible for marketing and selling IGT's products in Finland and the other Nordic countries.

With its new hub and office, IGT is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for slot machines in Northern Europe. The company's products are already popular in these markets, and its new investments should help it gain an even greater market share.
