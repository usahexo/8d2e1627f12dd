#  Detroit Pistons owner offers to buy LA Clippers

In a move that could shake up the NBA, Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores has offered to buy the LA Clippers from Donald Sterling.

Gores, who is of Lebanese descent, said in a statement: "I am committed to Detroit and its people. I am confident that together we can build a successful franchise that will bring pride and championships to the city."

The offer comes after Sterling was caught on tape making racist remarks about African Americans. Under pressure from the NBA, he agreed to sell the team.

A number of potential buyers have already been linked with the Clippers, including Oprah Winfrey and Floyd Mayweather Jr. However Gores' offer is likely to be more appealing as it would keep the team in Los Angeles.

The Pistons owner is no stranger to big deals. He made his fortune in private equity and has been involved in a number of high-profile transactions, including the purchase of Charter Communications in 2009.

#  Ilitch brothers making a move in LA

The Ilitch brothers have been making a lot of noise in the business world as of late. Their company, Little Caesars, was just named the fastest growing pizza chain in America. And now they are looking to make a move into the Los Angeles market.

The Ilitch brothers, Mike and Dan, are no strangers to the restaurant business. In addition to Little Caesars, they also own the popular Detroit-based chain Motor City Brewing Works. And now they are looking to replicate that success out west.

Their first move will be to open a new location of Motor City Brewing Works in downtown LA. The brewery will be located in the Arts District, an up-and-coming neighborhood that is quickly becoming a culinary hotspot.

“We’re excited to bring our handcrafted beers and artisanal pizzas to Downtown LA,” said Mike Ilitch Jr., president of Motor City Brewing Works. “This is an untapped market for us, and we believe there’s a lot of potential here. We can’t wait to get started.”

In addition to the brewery, the Ilitches are also planning to open a number of Little Caesars locations in the LA area. These will include both traditional sit-down restaurants as well as Quick Serve Restaurants (QSRs).

The Ilitches have been busy expanding their business empire in recent years. In addition to their restaurants, they also own the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings sports teams. They have recently made a number of high profile acquisitions, including naming rights to the new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.

#  Pistons, Red Wings owners looking to expand their empire

The Pistons and Red Wings owners, Tom Gores and Mike Ilitch, respectively, are looking to expand their business empires.

Gores is looking to buy Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable company in the United States. This would give him a controlling interest in the cable market, as he already owns a large portion of Charter Communications.

Ilitch is looking to purchase the Golden Pizza chain. This would add another 350 restaurants to his empire, which already includes Little Caesar's Pizza, Red Wings Stadium, and several other sports teams.

#  Ilitch clan looking to add another NBA team

After years of being rumored to be interested in buying an NBA franchise, the Ilitch family appears to be making some headway in their quest. The family, who owns the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, is in discussions with two groups about potentially acquiring an NBA team, according to a report from Crain's Detroit business.

The Ilitches have reportedly been in talks with a group that has designs on moving the Sacramento Kings to Detroit and with a group that would keep the Kings in Sacramento. There's no indication yet which of those groups the Ilitches are more interested in, but it's clear they're serious about getting into the NBA.

This wouldn't be the first time the Ilitches have ventured into professional sports outside of hockey and baseball. They used to own the Detroit Pistons before selling them in 2009, so they have some experience in this area.

There are a few things worth keeping in mind if the Ilitches do wind up buying an NBA team. First and foremost, they'll likely want to find a new home for the team if they do move it to Detroit. The Palace of Auburn Hills, where the Pistons currently play, is starting to show its age and isn't really suitable for an NBA team.

Secondly, there's no guarantee that this will actually turn out to be a profitable venture for the Ilitches. Professional sports teams can be risky investments, as we've seen with teams like the Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets that have been sold for record-breaking prices in recent years.

Ultimately, it'll be interesting to see what happens with this potential sale and whether or not the Ilitches end up adding an NBA team to their portfolio.

#  Could the Ilitch family be the new owners of the LA Clippers?

There's been speculation for months now that the Ilitch family, who own the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, are interested in buying the LA Clippers from current owner Donald Sterling.

The Ilitches are no strangers to owning sports teams; in addition to their holdings in Detroit, they also used to own the Joe Louis Arena, where the Red Wings play. They're a major force in Detroit's economy and are known for their philanthropy, so it's no surprise that they might be looking to expand into LA.

The Clippers have been up for sale since Sterling was banned from the NBA after making racist remarks. He originally put the team up for sale for $2 billion, but there has been no serious buyers yet. The Ilitches could be a perfect fit for the Clippers; they have the money to buy the team and they're not afraid to invest in a city that isn't their home base.

Some sports analysts are skeptical that the Ilitches would want to take on another team, considering all of their other holdings. However, if they can get a good deal on the Clippers, it could be a smart investment for them.
