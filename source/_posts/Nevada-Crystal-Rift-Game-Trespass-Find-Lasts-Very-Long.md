#  Nevada Crystal Rift Game Trespass Find Lasts Very Long

The trespassing of the Nevada Crystal Rift game by two unknown hackers has taken an unexpected turn as law enforcement officials have still not been able to apprehend the pair after a full week of investigation.

The game, which is accessible through a virtual reality headset, places players in a randomly generated dungeon filled with puzzles and creatures. The objective is to find the exit before time runs out.

While there have been other cases of people breaking into the game, this is the first time that anyone has managed to stay for more than a few minutes. Authorities believe that the two hackers have found a way to exploit a bug in the game code that allows them to bypass certain obstacles.

"They could be anywhere," said one detective working on the case. "These dungeons are massive, and there are all sorts of hidden passages and traps. It's like they're playing in their own world."

The hackers have managed to evade capture by hiding in areas that are difficult to reach or by disabling security cameras. They have also left messages for law enforcement taunting them with their success.
"You can't catch us," reads one message. "We are smarter than you."

As the search for the hackers continues, officials are urging anyone who has information about their whereabouts to come forward. In the meantime, they are asking gamers not to download or play the Nevada Crystal Rift game until it has been fixed.

In the State of Nevada, trespass is a criminal offense. The punishment for trespass can range from a simple fine to imprisonment. Carson City Code §8.12.010 defines trespass as:

"Every person who, without authority, goes into or upon any property after having been notified by the owner or tenant thereof not to enter or go upon such property, or who goes upon any railroad tracks in violation of NRS 452.160, is guilty of a misdemeanor."

In order for law enforcement to prosecute someone for trespass, the victim must first file a police report and provide evidence that the defendant was notified not to enter the property. Evidence that may be used to establish notice includes signage, fencing, and security cameras.

If you are convicted of trespass in Nevada, the court may impose any of the following penalties:

a fine of up to $1,000;

imprisonment for up to 6 months; or

both a fine and imprisonment.

Trespass is generally treated as a misdemeanor offense in Nevada. However, if the defendant has previously been convicted of trespassing on the same property within 7 years of the current offense, the charge can be elevated to a felony.
