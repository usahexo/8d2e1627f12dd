#  Wife Forced to Serve at Gambling Party

It was a scene right out of the movies. Men in suits and women in cocktail dresses gambling and drinking the night away. Only this wasn't Las Vegas, it was my husband's boss's house. And I was the croupier forced to deal cards and make drinks all night.

I had met my husband through work and we started dating soon after. He always told me about his boss, a powerful man who liked to gamble and party. I never imagined that I would be meeting him face-to-face.

When my husband told me that his boss was throwing a gambling party, I knew I didn't want to go. But he insisted that I come and "be professional." Professional? Dealing cards and making drinks for a bunch of drunk gamblers is not what I would call professional.

The party started late afternoon and went into the early hours of the morning. I dealt cards and made drinks until my hands were sore and my feet were tired. And the whole time, the boss stared at me with leering eyes, like he thought he could get lucky if he just waited long enough.

I was so relieved when the party finally ended and I could go home. Never again will I agree to do something like that. Being a croupier is not my idea of a good time.

#  Casino Server Wife Forced to Attend All-Male event

When most people think of a casino, the first thing that comes to mind is gaming. Slot machines, blackjack, and roulette are all popular options for players. However, there is another side to casinos that many people don't know about - the event side. Casino servers are responsible for hosting and running events such as poker tournaments, black tie galas, and charity balls. These events can be incredibly lucrative for the casino, and they often require a lot of planning and organization.

One woman who knows this all too well is my wife. She's a casino server and has been for over a decade. And over that time, she's been forced to attend countless all-male events. As you can imagine, this can be pretty frustrating for her. She's always the only woman in attendance, and she often feels out of place. This can make it difficult to do her job effectively.

Fortunately, things seem to be changing slightly in the industry. More and more casinos are hosting events that include female participants. This is a step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. Casino servers should not have to endure these types of events just because they are women. They are professionals who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

#  Wife Forced to Strip at Gambling Party


In a recent development, a woman was made to strip at a gambling party in order to cover up her husband's losses. The woman, who has not been named, was reportedly forced to take off all her clothes and dance for the men in attendance. This appalling act occurred despite the fact that the woman was visibly pregnant.

This incident is just one example of the many ways in which women are exploited and abused in the name of gambling. Women are often used as pawns by husbands or male friends who owe money, and they are routinely subjected to humiliation and violence. In some cases, women have even been trafficked into casinos specifically for this purpose.

It is time for the government to take action and put an end to this shameful practice. Gambling venues need to be held accountable for the way that they exploit and abuse women, and lawmakers need to implement stricter regulations to protect vulnerable members of society. Until then, women will continue to be victimised by the gambling industry.

#  Video Shows Wife Forced to Serve at Casino Event

Dozens of people, including a woman identified as the wife of a casino worker, were filmed being forced to serve at a Chinese New Year event at a casino in Sydney.

The woman can be seen crying and shaking as she is ordered to prepare food at the Lin Sen North Ryde function centre on January 25.

The footage was shot by a contractor who was working at the venue and handed to 9News. It is not clear if the woman is a employee of the casino.

“This is slavery, this is bullying, this is disgraceful,” one man can be heard saying in the footage.

Casino staff told 9News that they were “coerced” into working at the event and that they were not paid for their time.

“They made me work from 7am to 11pm,” one worker said. “I didn’t have any dinner and I only got an hour break.”

A spokesperson for the casino issued a statement saying that employees were “asked to volunteer” their time to help set up for the event and that they were later given “compensation for their time”.

However, workers say they were not given any choice in the matter and that they were threatened with dismissal if they did not participate.

One worker said he was even assaulted by security guards when he tried to leave the venue.

#  Female Server Forced to Attend Male-Only Gambling Party

As a female server, I was required to attend a male-only gambling party. I felt uncomfortable and out of place the entire time. It was incredibly sexist and offensive.

The party was hosted by one of the casino's high-rollers. He had invited all the male servers, as well as a few of the dealers and pit bosses. I was the only female there.

The host kept trying to get me to drink and gamble with him. He even offered me money to kiss him. I felt so uncomfortable and violated. I just wanted to leave.

These types of events are common in the casino industry, but that doesn't make them right. Casino owners and managers need to realize that it's not acceptable to exclude women from these events. It's discrimination and it needs to end.
