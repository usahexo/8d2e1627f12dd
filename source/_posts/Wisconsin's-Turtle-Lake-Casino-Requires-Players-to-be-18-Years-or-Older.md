#  Wisconsin's Turtle Lake Casino Sets Minimum Age at 18

The Turtle Lake Casino in Wisconsin has set its minimum age at 18, citing the need to "protect our youngest guests."

The decision comes amidst tightening regulations on casino gambling across the United States. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a law that barred states from legalizing sports betting, opening the door for more states to legalize gambling.

But the minimum age at casinos is still largely up to the individual establishments. In Nevada, for example, the minimum age is 21, while in New Jersey it's 18.

"We just felt that 18 was a good age," said Turtle Lake Casino spokesperson Jill Rau. "It gives people a chance to have some fun but also be adults."

The casino, which is operated by the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, also announced that it would be enhancing its security measures. This includes installing new facial recognition software to better detect underage gamblers.
