#  Britons lose millions in online gambling

Online gambling is becoming increasingly popular in the UK, with Brits losing millions of pounds every year. According to a report by the Gambling Commission, around 2.7 million people in Britain gambled online in 2016 – spending a total of £4.5 billion. This figure is up from 2.1 million people who gambled online in 2012, spending £2.7 billion in total.

The average British adult now spends around £170 a year on gambling activities, with online casino games and sports betting the most popular choices. Gambling Commission research shows that young people are particularly at risk, with one in five 16-24-year-olds saying they have gambled online in the last month.

Gambling can be addictive and can have serious consequences for those who lose control over their habit. In addition to financial losses, problem gambling can lead to relationship problems, joblessness and even suicide. The Gambling Commission is therefore calling for tougher regulation of the industry, including measures to protect vulnerable consumers and prevent children from accessing gambling websites.

The government has recently announced plans to increase taxes on gaming companies in order to fund treatment for problem gamblers. It is hoped that this will help to reduce the £1.5 billion annual cost of problem gambling to the economy.

The only downside to William Hill is that their website can be a little confusing to navigate at times. However, with such a large range of services on offer, William Hill is still one of the top choices for online gamblers in the UK.

#  Brits spending more on gambling overall 

The average Brit is spending £577 a year on gambling, according to a new study. This is an increase of £77 from the previous year. 

This increase is largely due to the growth of online gambling, which has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. In fact, online gambling now accounts for more than half of all gambling expenditure in the UK. 

The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that people aged 25-34 are the most likely to gamble. 

Gambling can be addictive and can have a negative impact on people’s lives. It’s therefore important to be aware of the risks involved and to only gamble responsibly.

#  Gambling industry booming in the UK 

The gambling industry is booming in the UK, with a record £13.8bn being wagered in 2017. This is an increase of 8% on the previous year, and equates to around £1,300 per adult. The main drivers of this growth are online gambling and the popularity of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs).

The online gambling industry has seen double-digit growth for the past six years, with annual revenues now totaling £4.5bn. This is due to the increasing number of people who are using their smartphones or other electronic devices to bet on sports or play casino games. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) estimates that there are now 2.9 million online gamblers in the country, up from 2.5 million in 2016.

Meanwhile, FOBTs have been blamed for contributing to a rise in problem gambling. There are now around 33,000 FOBTs in British betting shops, with over £1bn being wagered on them every year. This accounts for nearly half of all gambling losses in the UK. The government has announced plans to reduce the maximum stake on FOBTs from £100 to £2, in an effort to tackling problem gambling.

Despite these concerns, the overall gambling industry is still growing and is expected to reach £14.5bn by 2020. This growth is being driven by changing consumer behavior and new technology, as well as by the increasing availability of betting products and services.

#  More Brits turning to online gambling

The UK Gambling Commission’s annual report for 2017 has revealed that there has been a surge in Britons gambling online. The amount gambled online increased by 10% from 2016 to 2017, with consumers spending a total of £4.5 billion on remote gambling activities last year.

This increase is not surprising, as online gambling is becoming increasingly popular all over the world. In fact, in 2017 the global online gambling market was worth an estimated $52.5 billion, and it is forecast to grow to $81.7 billion by 2020.

So why are people increasingly choosing to gamble online? There are several reasons:

1) Convenience: Online gambling is extremely convenient, as you can gamble from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. This means you can fit gambling into your busy schedule and never have to miss out on a bet or game again.

2) Choice: With online gambling, you have access to a much wider range of games and betting options than you would at a traditional casino. You can find everything from slots and blackjack to sports betting and horse racing at online casinos, so you can always find something that suits your interests and budget.

3) Better odds: Online casinos often offer better odds than traditional casinos, meaning you have a higher chance of winning money when you gamble online. So if you’re looking for better chances of success, then online gambling may be the right choice for you.

4) Bonuses and rewards: Many online casinos offer generous bonuses and rewards to their customers, such as free spins, deposit matches, and loyalty programs. This means you can get extra value for your money when you gamble online, making it a more affordable option overall.
